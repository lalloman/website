            kai green, better known as yung kayo, has always struck me as an anomaly among the ever changing landscape of underground rap. the first time i heard his music was early 2020, when lil dre released ‘manifest destiny’, his debut thrasher part featuring ‘so much’ by yung kayo playing in the back. 
            the slow, menacing guitar riff combined with the distorted 808s and thugger-like vocal inflections immediately caught my attention. yung kayo clearly had the elements that would form the basis of ‘rage’ in his music long before the trend quickly caught on post-wlr. the most surprising thing however, is that yung kayo was only 16 - just about a year older than me. 
            ‘sweet16’, the 3 song ep it was from, also contained production from f1lthy and lukrative, names that would quickly become key to cartis later sound.
