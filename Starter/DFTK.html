            kai green, better known as yung kayo, has always struck me as an anomaly among the ever changing landscape of underground rap. the first time i heard his music was early 2020, when lil dre released ‘manifest destiny’, his debut thrasher part featuring ‘so much’ by yung kayo playing in the back. 
            the slow, menacing guitar riff combined with the distorted 808s and thugger-like vocal inflections immediately caught my attention. yung kayo clearly had the elements that would form the basis of ‘rage’ in his music long before the trend quickly caught on post-wlr. 
            the most surprising thing however, is that yung kayo was only 16 - just about a year older than me. ‘sweet16’, the 3 song ep it was from, also contained production from f1lthy and lukrative, names while already well established would quickly become key to cartis later sound.

            one name i didn't recognise though - warpstr. warpstr turned out to be kayo’s middle school friend and would become his long-time collaborator across multiple projects, and was the name behind ‘so much’. 
            warpstr was clearly very talented, listen to any of the beats on ‘+ + +’ or ‘- - -’ and you’ll quickly realise his talent when it comes to creating violent and sinister beats. simultaneously though, warpstr would be working with other artists such as PC Music’s umru, . 
            after catching thug’s attention and signing to ysl at such a young age, he would sparsely drop singles and eps over the upcoming 2 years, teasing DFTK with dozens of snippets.
